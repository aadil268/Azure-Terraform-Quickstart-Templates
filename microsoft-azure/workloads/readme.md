# Azure Terraform Workloads

This folder contains example Terraform workload templates that model specific workload deployments to Microsoft Azure. These are meant to be nearly complete workload templates so they only need to be customized slightly to get them working for your organization. Once the workload template is deployed, you'll be able to utilize the resources it provisions in your environment.

> **Production Use Warning:** Please do not use these workload templates _"as-is"_ for any Production workload. These workload templates are meant to be examples to get you 80% of the way towards your goal. Customizing it to fit your environment and organization are up to you. We do **NOT** provide any support for the usage or maintenance of these workload templates.
